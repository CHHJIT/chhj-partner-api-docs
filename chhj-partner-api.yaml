  title: CHHJ Partner Lead API
  description: >
    Endpoint for creating a new partner lead account and scheduling an outbound call for immediate follow-up during business hours.
    This API is typically used by partners to submit lead information in real-time. The system automatically initiates a call to the lead
    upon receipt. If your integration involves a live transfer or you prefer not to trigger an outbound call, please coordinate with the
    CHHJ team to support alternate routing. All partners must complete integration testing using the training server (`https://training.api.chhj.com`)
    before being permitted to send data to the production server.

      summary: Create Partner Lead
      description: >
        Creates a new partner lead account and initiates an outbound call to the lead during normal business hours.
        By default, this API is used for real-time lead intake with immediate contact attempts.
        Partners who prefer not to trigger a call (e.g., if they are transferring a call live) can work with the CHHJ team
        to set a no-call flag or alternate routing.
